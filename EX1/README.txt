This project contains the following files:
1. intervals.py which was supplied to us
2. Q1.py which contains the answers to question 1 of the practical part

In order to run the script:
go to directory: 'cd /specific/a/home/cc/students/cs/veredz1/workspace/ML-2017/EX1'
and then run the script using the format: '/usr/bin/python Q1.py --<question part>'
where <question part> can be either a, c, d, e

Examples:
'/usr/bin/python Q1.py --a'
'/usr/bin/python Q1.py --c'
'/usr/bin/python Q1.py --d'
'/usr/bin/python Q1.py --e'

It is also possible to run with '--help' in order to see all options.

All plots have axes names and legends as required with meaningful names.
