This project contains the following files:
1. intervals.py which was supplied to us
2. Q1.py which contains the answers to question 1 of the practical part

In order to run the script, use the format:
/usr/bin/python Q1.py --<question part>
where <question part> can be either a, c, d, e

Examples:
'/usr/bin/python --a'
'/usr/bin/python --c'
'/usr/bin/python --d'
'/usr/bin/python --e'

It is also possible to run with '--help' in order to see all options.

All plots have axes names and legends as required with meaningful names.
